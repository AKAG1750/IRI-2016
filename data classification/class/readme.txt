This code is used to sort the data in ''AU930_ROAM.txt'' from the oldest to the newest date.
Then, we write a median function that calculates foF2 and hmF2




To compile the sorter code, type in the terminal:

1 "make data " 
2 "./data " to create a data file without any character
3 "make fun" or "make class", 
4 "./fun" or "class" , to create the median function or classify the data



The sorted data is registered in the file named by defaults "tableSorted.txt"..
In addition, in the "MainMedainFun.c" file, we illustrated some example of numerical results from the median function
