Matlab is used to interpolate the data. The red grid is plotted using the "meshgrid" function where the 
input variables are created using linspace function. Then, scatter function is used to plot the data.

The stars in blue are created using similar function,except linspace. The data points were imported  
directly into the scatter function.

The graph plotted is included in the files.
